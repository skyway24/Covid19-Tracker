### Motivation
Most people in the world stay at home these days because of the lockdown. Most of you are frustrated about staying at home for a long time. Therefore, I utilize my time in developing COVID-19 tracking application.

### Problem statement
During COVID-19 there is a lack of accurate data of the covid cases. Every news channel is showing different COVID-19 statistics.

### Features
* Statistics about Coronavirus updated in every 15 minutes.
* Map View to get the overview of the Coronavirus Statistics of different countries.
* Detailed data for a particular Country.

### Future Goals
I will add the news tab to get the latest news about the Coronavirus from all over the world. Along with this, a WHO guidelines tab will be embedded for people safety and precaution.

### Instructions to run the project locally
